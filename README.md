# Blade router - Logos
This repo contains all of the logos and logo related files for use with
the packet blade project. 

## Repo structure

All images are designed using inkscape and are
saved as SVGs in the root of the repo. These SVGs are then rendered into
useful sizes in the `rendered` directory with the naming format
`name-widthxheight.format`.

## Logo design

All of the logos have been designed in house by people who are not
ordinarily graphic designers. If you have any suggestions on how we can
improve these logos, please just create an issue. We would be more than
happy to take your comments on board and improve the design.

## Licence
This repo uses the [REUSE](https://reuse.software) standard in order to
communicate the correct licence for the file. For those unfamiliar with
the standard the licence for each file can be found in one of three
places. The licence will either be in a comment block at the top of the
file, in a `.license` file with the same name as the file, or in the
dep5 file located in the `.reuse` directory. If you are unsure of the
licencing terms please contact
[contact@sidingsmedia.com](mailto:contact@sidingsmedia.com?subject=Blade%20Router%20Licence).
All files committed to this repo must contain valid licencing
information or the pull request can not be accepted.
